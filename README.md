This app is made to increase my understanding in react. It is supposed to show all the concepts of react that I have learned over my jorney, as of now. 

These include:
1) What is React and Why we use React?
2) Various Hooks such as useState, useReducer, useEffect, useRef and more...
3) It also displays my understandning of HTML/CSS 
4) Component based design of react.
